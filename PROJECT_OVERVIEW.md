## **Overview**

We plan to build a deep learning neural network model to predict rideshare pricing in New York City using the comprehensive FHV (For-Hire Vehicle) dataset, collected from 2019-2022. This dataset is highly comprehensive, having been collected by the NYC's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), and will allow us to create a powerful predictive model capturing complex relationships between many trip parameters (e.g., pickup & dropoff location, date & time, rideshare company, vehicle type, etc) and resulting fare costs.

## **Data Source**

The dataset contains extensive information on all For-Hire Vehicle trips in NYC, including:

●      Pickup and drop-off locations by TLC Taxi Zone

●      Trip timestamps (both request and actual pickup/dropoff)

●      Trip distance and duration

●      Base fare and various fees (tolls, taxes, surcharges)

●      Service provider information

●      Much more, see links below

## **Business Value**

### **For Riders**

●      Fare transparency: Allows riders to anticipate costs before booking  
●      Trip planning: Enabling better budgeting and comparison between transportation options, and optimize their rideshare trip planning efforts (e.g., identifying cost-efficient travel times to avoid surge pricing)

### **For Rideshare Companies (Uber, Lyft. . .)**

●      Dynamic pricing optimization: An alternative pricing fine-tuning algorithm based on predictive analytics

●      Resource allocation: Better driver deployment based on predicted demand patterns

●      Customer satisfaction: Improved price transparency leading to increased trust

### **For NYC Urban Planners**

●      Transportation equity analysis: Identifying areas with pricing disparities

●      Congestion management: Understanding how pricing affects traffic patterns

●      Policy development: Data-driven approach to regulate rideshare services
